run the cells of weather_icons_download.ipynb and you would have the icons downloaded(download directory depends on where python client binaries are if using the jupyter-notebook)
feel free to copy code from jupyter notebook so that you could run it as .py file since not everyone has jupyter notebook or conda installed on their PCs.
images would be downloaded in one folder which is then separate in two sub-folder called day and night to separate icons from mixing
